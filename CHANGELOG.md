## [Unreleased]

### 2026-08-31
- **feat(router):** the L7 half of inbound — a Host-header router over
  Gateway API HTTPRoutes, per stormpump docs/routing.md. Reads one request
  head, demuxes on Host, splices the connection (keep-alive, websockets and
  SSE ride free). Route table polled from the apiserver every 5 s, last good
  table kept across apiserver failures. Backends: the storm.io/backend
  annotation verbatim (how a node service says 127.0.0.1:port on every node
  without per-node manifests), else the first backendRef resolved to its
  Service clusterIP. \`[router]\` alone is a complete config — on a single
  node the VIP is the node's own address; \`vip\` is now optional.
